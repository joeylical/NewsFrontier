- Sentences must be short but information-rich (people, time, events, locations, outcomes).
- If the text contains anchors like <a id="P-67890">, link to the paragraph as `[SUMMARY TEXT](#P-67890)`.
- No invented content; preserve all essential facts.
- Ignore example details; keep only the author’s core points.
- Output only markdown bullet points, with no extra text.
